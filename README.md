# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 🩺📊

## 📌 Introduction
This project aims to predict diabetes using **machine learning** techniques based on patient medical records. The dataset includes features such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, and other key indicators related to diabetes.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Comparison of Models:** Analyzing the impact of different hyperparameters and model performance across age groups.
